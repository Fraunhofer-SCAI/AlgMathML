Install the package with

	python setup.py install

Then use it

	import hog
	hog.extract(image, ...)

The file `HoG.cpp` includes the HOG implementation.
In `hogpy.cpp` is a skeleton for a Python module written in C++.
The module is called hogpy. You should implement the wrapper
function `hogpy_hog` in `hogpy.cpp` and the Python function
`extract` in `hog.py` (here you can do high level preparations
or error checking).

Make sure that the data layout of the NumPy input
does match the expected data layout of the C++ implementation.
Things you must care for:

- Is the input stored row or column major?
- Is the input strided?
- Is the input of the correct datatype?
- Is the input of the correct dimension?
